<h1>The Best Movies According To Javonte</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Avengers: Endgame or Avengers: Infinity War</h3>
<p>I have this as a tie with it's prior movie, "Avengers: Infinity War". These movies were both a long time wait for it's fans and they did not dissapoint. It had everything for comdedy, spectacular action, and even hit me in the feels.</p>

<h3>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>This is probably one of my favorite animated movies of all time. It was nice to see another Spider-Man other tha the Peter Parker we all know. From the story telling to awesome art-style. 10 out of 10</p>

<h3>Creed III</h3>
<p>I really enjoyed this third installment in the Credd franchise. Not only is it a great and well choreographed boxing film, it had a really nice story. The story of two brother-like characters who have a falling out. And the little anime references were a nice touch.</p>
